 "an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests"
- why need seperate routers file?
- more control
- easy maintainable
- MVC or MVP pattern for best coding

## express.Router

## make few routes in application level

## seperate all routes inside seperate router file

## seperate (req, res)=>{} callback part into controllers/ folder and export and import them
