## Create a Model called "Product" where you should have below infos:
- productId
- title
- price
- discount
- seller
- quantity
- brand
- created date
- model no
- reviews

## create some routes for the product which can do these:
### /product/list: can show all product
### /product/:title: can show specific product based on req.body title from user
### /product/detail/:id : can show 1 product based onm _id
### /product/seller/:seller: can show how many products this seller have

# Try to make everything based on postman/thunderclient and display data there. No Manual data or object. Only try by req.body 

happy coding :)
