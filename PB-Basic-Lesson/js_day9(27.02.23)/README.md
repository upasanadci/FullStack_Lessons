## Note: do...while loop is similar to the while loop. The only difference is that in doâ€¦while loop, the body of loop is executed at least once.

### for Vs while Loop
A for loop is usually used when the number of iterations is known. For example,
```python
// this loop is iterated 5 times
for (let i = 1; i <=5; ++i) {
   // body of loop
}

```

### And while and do...while loops are usually used when the number of iterations are unknown. For example,
```python
while (condition) {
    // body of loop
}

```
