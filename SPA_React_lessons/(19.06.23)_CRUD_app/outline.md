### CRUD Reactjs app
CRUD means:
- C(CREATE)
- R(READ)
- U(Update)
- D(Delete)

### State data store:
- Context API
- Redux(not today)

### Questions of the day: Do you know data drilling problem among components?
- parent-child
- one child to parent 
- grandchildren to grandparent
- siblings to siblings

### solution: persist or global states

## Note: Context API or redux is optional, you dont need them unless its very complicated app with states

### what we will do today:
we will create a reactjs app where we can crud students of a classroom. This data will not store in Database, localstorage or any place only it will persist inside the app.
### Steps:
- Step 1:  lets make a small form for adding student data and show it in console.log
- Step 2:  make a studentlist component which displays all students
