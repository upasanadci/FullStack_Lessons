# Hyperlink

## What is a hyperlink?

Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web browser goes to another web address.

# Colors in CSS

RGB colors can be expressed through both hexadecimal (prefixed with #) and functional (rgb(), rgba()) notations.

-  ## RGB color model
The RGB color model defines a given color in the RGB color space according to its red, green, and blue components. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.


- ## Hexadecimal color model

A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color. All values must be between 00 and FF.
