## Importance of <alt>  tag in  <img> tag

- The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page
- The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

## What is an Absolute link

- an absolute link or URL provides the complete location information of your site. It contains both your domain name and page path.
- Absolute links are always unique, which means that using them helps prevent the risk of duplicate content. Here’s what it usually looks like: “<http://www.example.com/abc.html>”.

## What is a Relative Link?

- A relative link or URL only contains the path following your domain. It does not give the complete information location of your site, but instead, it conveys the address that is relative to where you are.  

- A relative link is commonly used by developers because it makes the process of website building easier. It normally looks like this: “/abc.html “
